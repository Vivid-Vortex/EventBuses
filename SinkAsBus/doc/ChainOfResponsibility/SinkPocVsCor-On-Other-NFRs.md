Compare Sink PoC and Chain of Responsibility on other NFR parameters.
---
To comprehensively compare **Sink POC (Project Reactor)** and **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)** on **non-functional requirements (NFRs**, such as **maintainability**, **extensibility**, **testability**, **fault tolerance**, **resource usage**, etc.), let’s analyze their characteristics.

---

### **1. Maintainability**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Curve**    | Steeper due to reactive paradigm and functional style.      | Low, as it relies on simple sequential logic. |
| **Code Readability**  | Reactive pipelines can be difficult to read/debug.          | Straightforward, with clear handler flow.   |
| **Ease of Updates**   | Flexible, changes are localized to operators or streams.    | Requires modifying or reordering the chain handlers. |
| **Documentation**     | Reactor libraries are well-documented but complex.          | CoR implementations are easier to document. |

- **Winner**: CoR (simpler for small, less dynamic systems).

---

### **2. Extensibility**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Adding Steps**      | Easy to add operators dynamically to the pipeline.          | Adding handlers is straightforward but might require chain reordering. |
| **Dynamic Handling**  | Supports runtime dynamic pipelines for complex workflows.   | Static chain requires compile-time knowledge of steps. |
| **Dependency Management** | Modular, each step/operator is independent.              | Handlers depend on the sequence; tight coupling may arise. |

- **Winner**: Sink POC (more dynamic and flexible).

---

### **3. Testability**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing**      | Requires mocking asynchronous streams and sink.             | Easier, each handler can be tested in isolation. |
| **Integration Testing** | Slightly complex due to reactive nature.                   | Straightforward; test chains end-to-end.    |
| **Debugging**         | Harder due to asynchronous stack traces.                    | Easier to pinpoint issues in sequential flow. |

- **Winner**: CoR (better for simple testing and debugging).

---

### **4. Fault Tolerance**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Error Handling**    | Built-in operators like `onErrorResume` and `retry`.         | Manual error handling in each handler.      |
| **Graceful Recovery** | Automatic backpressure ensures system stability.            | Requires custom fallback implementations.   |
| **Impact of Failure** | Faults can be isolated to specific streams/operators.       | A handler failure may propagate through the chain. |

- **Winner**: Sink POC (reactive streams handle faults more robustly).

---

### **5. Resource Usage**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **CPU Utilization**   | Efficient with non-blocking, asynchronous processing.       | Single-threaded (or custom multi-threaded). |
| **Memory Usage**      | Requires careful memory management with reactive streams.   | Minimal, as it's simpler and less stateful. |
| **Thread Management** | Optimized with `Schedulers` for parallelism.                | Uses fewer threads by default.              |

- **Winner**: Sink POC (better for high-throughput, resource-efficient systems).

---

### **6. Scalability**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Supports horizontal scaling with minimal refactoring.      | Difficult to scale due to synchronous nature. |
| **Vertical Scaling**  | Efficient, utilizes multi-core processors effectively.      | Limited by single-threaded design unless explicitly handled. |
| **Concurrency**       | Supports millions of concurrent events.                    | Sequential; concurrency must be implemented manually. |

- **Winner**: Sink POC (designed for scalable, event-driven systems).

---

### **7. Responsiveness**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Throughput**        | High, as processing is non-blocking and parallelizable.     | Limited by sequential, blocking handlers.   |
| **Latency**           | Minimal, provided backpressure is managed.                 | Higher latency due to synchronous processing. |

- **Winner**: Sink POC (ideal for real-time, low-latency requirements).

---

### **8. Complexity**
| **Aspect**            | **Sink POC (Project Reactor)**                              | **Chain of Responsibility (CoR)**          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Implementation Effort** | High; reactive paradigm requires understanding streams.   | Low; straightforward design and execution.  |
| **Learning Curve**    | Steeper for those unfamiliar with reactive programming.      | Easier to learn and implement.              |

- **Winner**: CoR (better for simple or low-complexity systems).
