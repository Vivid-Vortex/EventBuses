The **Project Reactor Bus** is a part of the Reactor library, which is a powerful framework for building reactive applications in Java. The Reactor Bus provides a lightweight and flexible **event-driven messaging system**. It allows decoupled components to communicate via events, making it well-suited for building reactive microservices, asynchronous applications, or systems requiring event-driven architectures.

Here’s an explanation of its components and functionality:

---

### Key Components:
1. **Event**:
    - Represents a message or signal to be processed.
    - Contains both the data payload and metadata, such as the event key.

2. **Bus**:
    - Acts as the central hub for event publishing and subscription.
    - Events are published to the bus and routed to appropriate subscribers based on keys or topics.

3. **Selector**:
    - Matches event keys with subscriber keys to determine where the event should be routed.
    - Provides flexibility to use patterns like exact matches, wildcards, or regex for routing.

4. **Subscriber**:
    - A consumer that listens for specific events on the bus.
    - Handles the events when they are routed by the bus.

5. **Dispatcher**:
    - Manages the threading and execution of event processing.
    - Examples include single-threaded, multi-threaded, or work-stealing dispatchers.

---

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Supports non-blocking event processing.
- **Flexibility in Event Routing**: Use of selectors allows routing based on keys or patterns.
- **High Performance**: Efficient handling of events through dispatchers.
- **Decoupling**: Components interact via events, reducing tight coupling.

---

### Example Usage:
Here’s a simple example to demonstrate the Project Reactor Bus:

```java
import reactor.bus.Event;
import reactor.bus.EventBus;

import static reactor.bus.selector.Selectors.$;

public class ReactorBusExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an EventBus
        EventBus eventBus = EventBus.create();

        // Register a Subscriber
        eventBus.on($("topic"), event -> {
            System.out.println("Received event: " + event.getData());
        });

        // Publish an Event
        eventBus.notify("topic", Event.wrap("Hello, Reactor Bus!"));

        // Clean up resources (not always necessary, but good practice)
        eventBus.getDispatcher().shutdown();
    }
}
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **EventBus Creation**:
    - `EventBus.create()` initializes a new event bus instance.

2. **Subscriber Registration**:
    - `eventBus.on($("topic"), ...)` registers a subscriber that listens for events with the key `"topic"`.

3. **Event Publishing**:
    - `eventBus.notify("topic", Event.wrap("..."))` publishes an event with the key `"topic"` and the data `"Hello, Reactor Bus!"`.

4. **Event Handling**:
    - The subscriber is triggered and processes the event by printing the event data.

---

### Use Cases:
- **Microservices Communication**: Lightweight event bus for inter-service communication.
- **Real-time Systems**: Handling streams of real-time events.
- **Decoupled System Components**: Facilitating loose coupling in modular applications.

---

Although **Project Reactor Bus** was widely used, it is worth noting that **modern Reactor usage emphasizes reactive streams and Flux/Mono constructs**. The bus-style architecture is still useful for specific scenarios, but newer patterns (like reactive pipelines) are often preferred.

### Comparison with Google Guava EventBus

### **Google Guava EventBus**

**Google Guava EventBus** is a lightweight, simple-to-use library for event-driven programming. It is part of the Guava library and facilitates communication between decoupled components using publish-subscribe patterns.

#### **Key Features of Guava EventBus**
1. **Annotation-based Subscribers**:
    - Methods in subscriber classes are annotated with `@Subscribe` to listen to specific events.

2. **Thread-Safe**:
    - EventBus handles thread safety, making it suitable for concurrent applications.

3. **Synchronous Event Dispatching**:
    - Events are delivered synchronously in the same thread that publishes the event.

4. **Hierarchical Event Handling**:
    - Subscribers can listen to events and their subclasses (e.g., subscribing to `Object` captures all events).

---

#### **Example Usage of Guava EventBus**
```java
import com.google.common.eventbus.EventBus;
import com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe;

class EventSubscriber {
    @Subscribe
    public void handleEvent(String event) {
        System.out.println("Received event: " + event);
    }
}

public class GuavaEventBusExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an EventBus instance
        EventBus eventBus = new EventBus();

        // Register a subscriber
        eventBus.register(new EventSubscriber());

        // Post an event
        eventBus.post("Hello, Guava EventBus!");
    }
}
```

    - Reactor Bus is asynchronous, making it better suited for high-throughput systems.

2. **Usage Simplicity**:
    - Guava EventBus has a lower learning curve, as it relies on annotations and standard Java objects.
    - Reactor Bus requires understanding of reactive principles, making it more advanced but also more powerful.

3. **Performance and Scalability**:
    - Guava EventBus works well for lightweight, single-threaded, or low-concurrency applications.
    - Reactor Bus excels in high-performance scenarios requiring concurrency and non-blocking behavior.

4. **Integration with Modern Architectures**:
    - Reactor Bus aligns with modern reactive systems (e.g., microservices, reactive pipelines).
    - Guava EventBus is simpler but less suited for reactive patterns.

---

### **When to Use Each?**
- **Guava EventBus**:
    - Suitable for small, straightforward applications.
    - Ideal for desktop applications or systems where synchronous event delivery is sufficient.

In modern development, **Reactor Bus** is often preferred for its asynchronous capabilities and better fit for reactive architectures. However, **Guava EventBus** remains a great choice for simpler, traditional applications.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Google Guava EventBus and Reactor Bus Hand in Hand

You're correct that **both Google Guava EventBus and Reactor Bus serve similar purposes**, i.e., decoupled communication between components, but their primary difference lies in **synchronous (Guava)** versus **asynchronous (Reactor)** communication.

---

### **Using EventBus in a Layered Architecture of Microservice `Micro-A`**

Yes, you can use these libraries to separate the layers (validator, mappers, database, etc.) of your microservice. Here's how this would work:

1. **Decoupling Layers**:
    - Instead of directly invoking methods of other layers, events can act as the communication medium between these layers.
    - Each layer listens for specific events, processes them, and emits new events, which are consumed by other layers.

2. **Event-driven Flow**:
    - For example, `Micro-A` receives an event from Kafka, validates it, maps it to a domain object, persists it in the database, and sends a response:
        - **Validator Layer**: Listens for incoming raw events, validates them, and emits a `ValidatedEvent`.
        - **Mapper Layer**: Converts the validated event into a domain model and emits a `DomainMappedEvent`.
        - **Database Layer**: Listens for `DomainMappedEvent` and performs database operations.

---

### **Guava EventBus in Micro-A**
Using Guava would result in a synchronous flow, where each layer is triggered sequentially in the same thread.

#### **Example Workflow**
```java
import com.google.common.eventbus.EventBus;
import com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe;

// Event Classes
class RawEvent {
    public String message;
    public RawEvent(String message) { this.message = message; }
}

class ValidatedEvent {
    public String validatedData;
    public ValidatedEvent(String validatedData) { this.validatedData = validatedData; }
}

// Validator Layer
class Validator {
    @Subscribe
    public void validate(RawEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Validating: " + event.message);
        EventBusManager.EVENT_BUS.post(new ValidatedEvent("Validated: " + event.message));
    }
}

// Mapper Layer
class Mapper {
    @Subscribe
    public void map(ValidatedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Mapping: " + event.validatedData);
        // Further steps...
    }
}

// EventBus Manager
class EventBusManager {
    static final EventBus EVENT_BUS = new EventBus();
}

public class MicroA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventBus eventBus = EventBusManager.EVENT_BUS;

        // Register layers
        eventBus.register(new Validator());
        eventBus.register(new Mapper());

        // Post initial event
        eventBus.post(new RawEvent("Raw Data from Kafka"));
    }
}
```

---

### **Reactor Bus in Micro-A**
With Reactor Bus, the flow becomes asynchronous, allowing each layer to execute independently and possibly in parallel.

#### **Example Workflow**
```java
import reactor.bus.Event;
import reactor.bus.EventBus;
import static reactor.bus.selector.Selectors.$;

// Event Classes
class RawEvent {
    public String message;
    public RawEvent(String message) { this.message = message; }
}

class ValidatedEvent {
    public String validatedData;
    public ValidatedEvent(String validatedData) { this.validatedData = validatedData; }
}

// Validator Layer
class Validator {
    public void validate(Event<RawEvent> event) {
        System.out.println("Validating: " + event.getData().message);
        ReactorBusManager.EVENT_BUS.notify("validatedEvent",
                Event.wrap(new ValidatedEvent("Validated: " + event.getData().message)));
    }
}

// Mapper Layer
class Mapper {
    public void map(Event<ValidatedEvent> event) {
        System.out.println("Mapping: " + event.getData().validatedData);
        // Further steps...
    }
}

// Reactor Bus Manager
class ReactorBusManager {
    static final EventBus EVENT_BUS = EventBus.create();
}

public class MicroA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventBus eventBus = ReactorBusManager.EVENT_BUS;

        // Register listeners
        eventBus.on($("rawEvent"), new Validator()::validate);
        eventBus.on($("validatedEvent"), new Mapper()::map);

        // Publish initial event
        eventBus.notify("rawEvent", Event.wrap(new RawEvent("Raw Data from Kafka")));
    }
}
```
